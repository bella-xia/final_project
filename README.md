Our Research Question: How do different public health issues correlate with high school graduation rates across neighborhoods in Baltimore, and which are the most influential?

Our Method: 
 
 1. Collect data from the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicator Alliance website (https://bniajfi.org/) of different public health issues and dimensions of well-being.
      
           - Number of Overdose Calls for Service Per 1000 People
      
           - Rate of Dirty Streets and Alleys Reports per 1000 Residents
      
           - Number of Persons with Library Cards per 1000 Residents
      
           - Percent of Households with No Internet at Home
      
           - Percent of Children Living Below the Povery Line
      
           - Percent of Female-Headed Households with Children Under 18
      
           - Percentage of Residential Properties that are Vacant and Abandoned
      
           - Violent Crime Rate per 1,000 Residents
      
           - Household Income
      
           - Number of Businesses that are Arts-Related per 1000 Residents
    
 2. Plot data against high school completion rates for each neighborhood in Baltimore.
  
 3. Find R-values to deduce which factor is most influential in high school completion rates.
