## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Including Plots

1. Load in `graduation` data

```{r}
graduation <- read.csv('graduation.csv')
```


2. View the data
```{r}
head(graduation,55)
```

3. View a summary of the data
```{r}
summary(graduation)
```

4. R calculation
```{r}
calculate_R <- function(column) {
  c <- column
  n <- 55
  x <- 0
  y <- 0
  xx <- 0
  yy <- 0
  xy <- 0
  for (i in 1:n) {
    x = x + graduation[i,c]
    y <- y + graduation[i,3]
    xx <- xx + graduation[i,c]^2
    yy <- yy + graduation[i,3]^2
    xy <- xy + graduation[i,c] * graduation[i,3]
  }
  R <- (n*xy - x*y) / sqrt((n*xx - x^2) * (n*yy - y^2))
  return(R)
}
```
